## My Reading list
---
The following are a list of the books I am reading and have already read. This list is mostly here to keep track of books I find especially good and also to motivate myself to read more. I usually read one book every 1-2 weeks and expect to read about 40 books a year. The list will be catagorized on a year by year basis starting with 2020.
